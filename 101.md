This page provides the list of topics and  transcripts from  "Lunches and Learn" sessions of the R Ottawa Data Science community . Information about those sessions is provided [here](https://ivi-m.github.io/R-Ottawa/meetups.html).

If you missed a session, you can watch from **YouTube channel**: ["Learning R together" (Building Data Science Apps from scratch - together)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUogPW3t8g0RFvDGyKo1murnQUaSJxEPl)

- In our second session, we will continue from where we left: we will open the .csv file from JHU and visualize in a number of ways. The R script that we have started creating last time in rstudio.cloud is copied to [/r101 ](https://github.com/IVI-M/R-Ottawa/tree/master/r101) :  `00-read.R`

Topics covered: 

- Overview of the new purpose and functionality of [iTrack Covid App](https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid) (v0.0.5 Canadian Edition - "Should I go or should I stay"). We'll now be adding the same functionality to US data - together with you.
- General coding process & mental framework: Running our first line - Trouble-shooting - Organizing code  
- Getting help: all knowledge you need is with you  already! (for more stackoverflow
- General process of getting to know your "stranger" (data) and making something nice out of it: ways to view it, print it and plot it, easier to work with
  - removing unneeded columns, `melt`ing data, renaming columns
- New way of archiving your thoughts, results and generate ideas: R Markdown

## Session 1: 2020/04/29 - [video](https://youtu.be/d_EC39tIWMQ) / [transcript]()

Topics covered: 

1- your first steps to start learning R:  go to www.rstudio.com,  and follow to Resources- Education-For Learners-Tutorials-   ending up in https://rstudio.cloud and finding there: Learn - Primers - The Basics - Visualization Basics
2- your  first steps to start programming in R: New Project, New File - R Script, first executed one line (to read .csv file using `fread() )`, first error (`could not find function`), first installed package (`library(data.table)`)
3- your first R-powered document and App: New File - R Markdown
4- your first tricks: Table of Content, commenting out the text and codes

Take-aways:

- keep all useful libraries and functions in one place: `source("000-common.R')`
- `data.table` package (aka library) is your best new friend
- Make use of the `Table of contents` to build the  structure for your code that is easy to navigate
  - `#  #  1.1 Merging data   ----
- commenting out unneeded code with `#` (CTRL+SHIFT+C)
- commenting out in chunks using `if (F) { # 0. General libraries and functions ----
- think and code in chunks
- App is an R Markdown, which runs your code
- commenting out unneeded text with `<!--` - `-->` (CTRL+SHIFT+C)
- Two ways of educating yourself: 1) follow tutorials included in rstudio.cloud, 2) start building own own little script with some public data that you always wanted to dig in!
