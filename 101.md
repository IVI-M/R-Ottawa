This page provides transcripts, topics and take-aways from the "Lunches and Learn" sessions of the R Ottawa Data Science community. Sessions are done via Zoom each Wednesday and Friday, are open to public and are recorded. Dial-in instructions are provided [here](https://ivi-m.github.io/R-Ottawa/meetups.html). 

We code in [https://rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud). The codes that we are discussing and writting together are archived in [/r101 ](https://github.com/IVI-M/R-Ottawa/tree/master/r101) folder.

Commonly, each session touches on three topics:   
- iTrack Covid App: what's new,  new insights  it provides  about the pandemic, what else we wish it could to do.
- Learning and Coding in R: using Covid data and  iTrack Covid App, as example.
- General discussion: on Computing Science,  Data Science, Community, Portal, Resources, other contributions for Ottawa/Canada.

## Session 1: 2020/04/29 - [video](https://youtu.be/d_EC39tIWMQ) / [transcript](r101-transcript-01.md)

Topics covered: 

1. your first steps to start learning R:  go to www.rstudio.com,  and follow to Resources- Education-For Learners-Tutorials-   ending up in [https://rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) and finding tutorials there: Learn - Primers - The Basics - Visualization Basics
2. your  first steps to start programming in R: New Project, New File - R Script, first executed one line (to read .csv file using `fread() )`, first error (`could not find function`), first installed package (`library(data.table)`)
3. your first R-powered document and App: New File - R Markdown
4. your first tricks and take-aways

Take-aways:

- Keep all useful libraries and functions in one place: `source("000-common.R')`
- `library(data.table)` is your best new friend
- Run line by line with (CTRL+ENTER)
- Make use of the `Table of contents` to build the  structure for your code that is easy to navigate: `#  1.1 Merging data   ----`
- Comment out unneeded code in R Script with `#` (CTRL+SHIFT+C)
- Comment out in chunks using `if (F) { # 0. General libraries and functions ----`
- Think and code in chunks
- Use R Markdown to organize your ideas and results (iTrack Covid App is just an R Markdown)
- Comment out  unneeded text in R Markdown with `<!--` - `-->` (CTRL+SHIFT+C)
- Two ways of educating yourself: 1) follow many tutorials (some bult in rstudio.cloud), 2) start building own own data science tool and seek answers as you go!


## Session 2: 2020/05/06  - [video](https://youtu.be/QSMc-or5DcA) 

- In our second session, we will continue from where we left: we will open the .csv file from JHU and analyze it in a number of ways. The R script that we have started creating last time in rstudio.cloud is copied to [/r101 ](https://github.com/IVI-M/R-Ottawa/tree/master/r101) folder:  `01-read.R`

Topics covered: 

- Overview of the new purpose and functionality of [iTrack Covid App](https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid) (v0.0.5 Canadian Edition - "Should I go or should I stay"). We'll now be adding the same functionality to US data - together with you.
- General coding process & mental framework: Running our first line - Trouble-shooting - Organizing code  
- Getting help: all knowledge you need is with you  already! : Build-in Help and www.Stackoverflow.com
- General process of getting to know your "stranger" (data) and making something nice out of it: ways to view it, print it and plot it, easier to work with
  - removing unneeded columns, `melt`ing data, renaming columns
  - your next best friend: `library(magrittr)`
  
  
## Session 3: 2020/05/13  - [video - TBD]() 
  
Topics covered:    
- This session will be dedicated entirely to  analyzing the situation in US
- Simple complete Covid App (R Markdown) example (no-interactivity)

Theory: (`01-read.R`)  
- more about data.table: `dt[ i, j, by]` :  
   `dtUSc[ state=="New York" & city == "New York"", sum(value), by=type]`
- conditional viewing of data.table: `dt=
  - show for state New York, city New York, 
  - show all with more than 100,000 / day
- merging data-sets - using `merge` and `dtGeo[dtUS]`

R Markdown: (`01-report.Rmd`)  
- report ther results from `01-read.R`
- Showing how to run https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-12.html in rstudio.cloud 


 
## Session 4: 2020/05/15  - [video - TBD]() 
  
We'll continue where we left: merging it all, running it all, and plotting!  

- Starting graphs!
  - You Third biggest friend: `library(ggplot2)`
