This page provides the list of topics and  transcripts from  "Lunches and Learn" sessions of the R Ottawa Data Science community . Information about these sessions and dial-in instructions are provided [here](https://ivi-m.github.io/R-Ottawa/meetups.html). The codes that we are discussing and writting together are archived in [/r101 ](https://github.com/IVI-M/R-Ottawa/tree/master/r101) folder.

Sessions are done via Zoom each Wednedsaday and are recorded. If you missed a session, you can watch it from **YouTube channel**: [R101: "Learning R together" (Building Data Science Apps from scratch)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUogPW3t8g0RFvDGyKo1murnQUaSJxEPl)



## Session 1: 2020/04/29 - [video](https://youtu.be/d_EC39tIWMQ) / [transcript](r101-transcript-01.md)

Topics covered: 

1. your first steps to start learning R:  go to www.rstudio.com,  and follow to Resources- Education-For Learners-Tutorials-   ending up in https://rstudio.cloud and finding there: Learn - Primers - The Basics - Visualization Basics
2. your  first steps to start programming in R: New Project, New File - R Script, first executed one line (to read .csv file using `fread() )`, first error (`could not find function`), first installed package (`library(data.table)`)
3. your first R-powered document and App: New File - R Markdown
4. your first tricks and take-aways

Take-aways:

- Keep all useful libraries and functions in one place: `source("000-common.R')`
- `library(data.table)` is your best new friend
- Run line by line with (CTRL+ENTER)
- Make use of the `Table of contents` to build the  structure for your code that is easy to navigate: `#  1.1 Merging data   ----`
- Comment out unneeded code in R Script with `#` (CTRL+SHIFT+C)
- Comment out in chunks using `if (F) { # 0. General libraries and functions ----`
- Think and code in chunks
- Use R Markdown to organize your ideas and results (iTrack Covid App is just an R Markdown)
- Comment out  unneeded text in R Markdown with `<!--` - `-->` (CTRL+SHIFT+C)
- Two ways of educating yourself: 1) follow many tutorials (some bult in rstudio.cloud), 2) start building own own data science tool and seek answers as you go!


## Session 2: 2020/05/06  - [video](https://youtu.be/QSMc-or5DcA) / [transcript - TBD](r101-transcript-02.md)


- In our second session, we will continue from where we left: we will open the .csv file from JHU and analyze it in a number of ways. The R script that we have started creating last time in rstudio.cloud is copied to [/r101 ](https://github.com/IVI-M/R-Ottawa/tree/master/r101) folder:  `00-read.R`

Topics covered: 

- Overview of the new purpose and functionality of [iTrack Covid App](https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid) (v0.0.5 Canadian Edition - "Should I go or should I stay"). We'll now be adding the same functionality to US data - together with you.
- General coding process & mental framework: Running our first line - Trouble-shooting - Organizing code  
- Getting help: all knowledge you need is with you  already! : Build-in Help and www.Stackoverflow.com
- General process of getting to know your "stranger" (data) and making something nice out of it: ways to view it, print it and plot it, easier to work with
  - removing unneeded columns, `melt`ing data, renaming columns
  - your next best friend: `library(magrittr)`
  
  
 ## Session 3: 2020/05/13  - [video - TBD]() / [transcript - TBD](r101-transcript-03.md) 
  
Topics covered: 

- more about data.table: `dt[ i, j, by]` :  
   `dtUSc[ state=="New York" & city == "New York"", sum(value), by=type]`

- conditional viewing of data
  - viewing US covid data for state New York, city New York, 
  - all with more than 100,000 / day
- merging data-sets (US covid confirmed with US covid death data)
- You Third biggest friend: `library(ggplot2)`

- Back to R Markdown:  New way of archiving your thoughts, results and generate ideas - and  building Apps
