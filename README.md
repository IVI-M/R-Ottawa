Ok - starting this week, we'll show you how you can start learning and using R in absolutely no time and even without any software installed on your computer. All you'll need is to login to [https://rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) and we'll guide you through after that. We will be developing a Covid App such as iTrack Covid() from scratch - together! Sessions will be recorded.
