<!-- We will show you how to use Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (in R and from scratch) to automatically extract -->
We can show you how to use Data Science (in R) to extract
insights from the [Public Service Employee Survey (PSES)](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/innovation/public-service-employee-survey.html) results - similar to how this is done [here](https://itrack.shinyapps.io/PSES/). To enroll and more details - see [ R101](101.md).

- We've heard you: You want to get all the power and fun of R, but you don't know where to start (and   may not even have it installed on your machine). --  Starting this week, we'll show you how you can start learning and using R in absolutely no time and even without any software installed on your computer! All you'll need is to login to [https://rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) and we'll guide you through after that. We will be developing a COVID App from scratch - together! Sessions will be recorded.
