### News:  

2021-02-27: GC employees, head to [https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca/r4gc](https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca/r4gc) for more resources and codes related to R coding and usage at GC! Join us for informal 'Lunch and Learn's meet-ups every Friday at 11:30. - See [GCcollab](https://gccollab.ca/groups/activity/7071541) for more information.

2021-02-21:
- Data Engineering Demo is ready for presentation at the #GCData2021 Conference Data Literacy workshop: [https://rCanada.shinyapps.io/demo/](https://rCanada.shinyapps.io/demo/). See workshop page for more information in [GCcollab](https://gccollab.ca/groups/activity/7071541)

- Join us at the *Data Engineering workshop* on 22 February, organized within the Fifth Annual Data Conference ([#GCData2021 / #Donn√©esGC2021](https://wiki.gccollab.ca/2021_Data_Conference/Agenda)). Hosted by CBSA, the workshop will overview the challenges and solutions related to data engineering. You will be able to experience some of data engineering  challenges first-hand, and see how these challenges can be solved using  modern  data science tools such as R and RStudio. The work on developing an R package and Shiny application to assist with data cleaning and linking will be presented. Details and registration: [here](https://www.csps-efpc.gc.ca/events/data-conference2021/).

- Following the announcement at the Data Science Network for the Federal Public Service (DSNFPS) [newsletter](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/data-science/network/newsletter), we received multiple requests for another R training, like the one we did last Summer. Why not?
<!-- - Let's do it then!  Tentative starting date -  First Friday of March 2021 (after #GCData2021  Conference).
We will show you how to use Data Science (in R) to gain
insights from the [Public Service Employee Survey (PSES)](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/innovation/public-service-employee-survey.html) results - similar to how this is done [here](https://itrack.shinyapps.io/PSES/). -->
To enroll and more details - see [ R101](101.md).    

2020-06-05:
- We finished the first season, where we learnt how to write an interactive dashboard that visualizes the COVID datain US. - You can see the final result [here](https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid/us.Rmd)!   All codes are posted. Resources are updated. Have great summer!

2020-05-13:
-  35 mins a week seemed not enough... Following requests, we'll add another R101 "Lunch and Learn" session on Fridays, the same time.
- Ideas for homework are added in [ Resources](resources.md)

2020-05-03:
- YouTube channel created: [R101 "Learning R together" (Building Data Science Apps from scratch)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUogPW3t8g0RFvDGyKo1murnQUaSJxEPl). If you missed a session, you can now watch it there. Session transcripts are also posted in  [ R101](101.md).


2020-04-28:
- We've heard you: You want to get all the power and fun of R, but you don't know where to start (and   may not even have it installed on your machine). --  Starting this week, we'll show you how you can start learning and using R in absolutely no time and even without any software installed on your computer! All you'll need is to login to [https://rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) and we'll guide you through after that. We will be developing a COVID App from scratch - together! Sessions will be recorded. 

<!-- 2020-04-15: 
- Codes to read Covid data from UofT and JHU are added to [ /r101](https://github.com/IVI-M/R-Ottawa/tree/master/r101) folder.
-->

2020-04-01:     
- Invitation to [Lunches with Data Challenges](meetups.md) meet-ups is extended from CBSA to all GoC. See: [GCCollab](https://gccollab.ca/discussion/view/4482867/enlunches-with-data-challenges-on-wednesdays-on-rfr)* 
- The focus of discussion becomes Covid-19 and what we (R enthusiasts and learners) can do about it.

2020-03-18
- Our informal Wednesday's "Morning Coffees with Data Challenges" meetings, which we've been having in CBSA since  Summer 2019, go online,  becoming "Lunches".
